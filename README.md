# Budget Tracker

This budget tracker app allows the user to enter items and their cost to be saved in a database and charted on a line graph for them.

Offline functionality was added, so when offline, a user can still add items. When the user connects to the internet again, the items will post to the database still and the total will be updated. 

## Installation

## Usage
